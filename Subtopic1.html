               This website touches on the discussion of whether it's better to buy a prebuilt PC or to build your own PC yourself. The article mentions different reasons why it's a lot better to build your own PC over just buying a prebuilt system, like customization, cost, and how it helps you to start knowing your  own system. The article is not completely biased though, because it also mentions benefits of buying your own PC, like how it's more convenient, and how buying a PC guarantees that you have a warranty that will keep your system safe in case anything happens to it before a certain date.

                In this article, the author Evan Lahti tells his own personal story with how he started being interested in PC building and in gaining knowledge about computers. He mentions some things that are very interesting like how the gaming hobby has been overtaken by consumerism, and how it does not have to be this way. Building your own PC might be a bit more tedious than just buying a prebuilt one, but it is a much more rewarding process, and you gain a lot of knowledge while researching which parts are best for your computer.
